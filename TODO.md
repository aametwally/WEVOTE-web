#### Roadmap items
* Webserver
* Cross platform (should be tested)
* Single sample visualization: Phylogeny, tools agreement Venn diagram, identification score histogram of the 
* Multiple samples visualization: Anvio wheel, heatmap.
* Cloud-based with bidding system
* Test cases
* Code documentation.
* GitHub (follow the 10 rules)
* Validation using simulated data.
* Validation using Mock libraries.
* Tutorials.
* Add novel analysis idea (will discuss once we finish all the above).

#### VIZ
* Tools agreement Venn diagram
* Phylogeny visualization: Radial Tidy Tree: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063550
* Enhance Abundance visualization: using hierarchial color palette to represent abundance tree.

* Identification score histogram


#### Backend
* Communicate server with wevote service. Ideas:
(1) Integrate wevote app inside a C++ web app. Issue requests from the wevote-web app to wevote-service.
